NLP (Natural Language Processing)
=================================

The process of computers segmenting, processing and gaining context from
written text.

Glossary
--------

* **Tokenization:** Demarcate & classify sections of a string. eg. split
  sentence on word breaks. (Parsing sub-task).
* **Lemmatization:** Dictionary lookup of base words to support removal of word
  endings.
* **Stemming:** Rule-based removal of word endings to return base form of a
  word.
* **POS (Part of Speech) Tagging:** Returns context of words that can be used
  in different ways depending on context. eg. noun/verb/adjective.
* **Sentence Breaking:** Or Sentence Boundary Disambiguation, to find sentence
  endings, but also handle re-use of periods/punctuation-marks in non-sentence
  ending situations (eg. abbreviations).
* **Grammar Induction:** Generate the formal grammar to describe the language's
  syntax.
* **Parsing:** Dependency/Consistency Parsing to discover relationship between
  words in a sentence.
* **NER (Named Entity Recognition):** Map to proper names (people/places) +
  type (person/location/organisation).
* **Terminology Extraction:** Extract relevant terms.
* **WSD (Word Sense Disambiguation):** Dictionary/lookup-based word meaning
  based off context for words with multiple meanings.
* **Relationship Extraction:** Identify relationships between Named Entities.
* **Conference Resolution:** Determine the Mentions that refer to the same
  Entities. Also deals with _"Referring Expressions"_ & Bridging
  Relationships"_. eg. _"He entered John's house through the front door."
    * Referring Expression: _"the front door"_.
    * Bridging Relationship: The front door belongs to John's house.
* **Discourse Analysis:** Discourse Relationships between sentences
  (eg. elaboration, explanation, contrast), or classifying Speech Acts
  (boolean/context question, statement, assertion...).
* **Recognising Textual Entailment:** Truth/False/Negation between two text
  fragments.
* **Topic Segmentation:** Separate text into topics.
* **Argument Mining:** Argument discovery + main/subsidiary argument or
  main/counter argument relationships.
* **Automatic/Text Summarization:** Generate a summary from a text block.
* **Document AI:** NLP-based (AI/ML) Platform for non-technical users to
  extract data from documents.
* **Corpus:** ML trained model, with a targeted domain.
